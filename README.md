# Fingerprint-Based-Door-Locking-System
This project is an Arduino-based fingerprint door lock system that uses the Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor module. It allows users to enroll fingerprints, store them in a database, and verify fingerprints to control a door lock. The system also features a buzzer for feedback during enrollment and access verification.
